This project carries out complex and comprehensive supervised machine learning tasks and analyses by implementing several machine learning models/algorithms (Decision Tree, Neural Network, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine and k-Nearest Neighbor models, each with different hyper-parameters) on two datasets. The first dataset is a Rice (Cammeo and Osmancik) dataset, a multivariate binary classification dataset, obtained at the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/545/rice+cammeo+and+osmancik), for two types of rice species grown in Turkey (Cammeo and Osmancik). The dataset has 3810 instances and contains seven (7) features in the feature set (X). the target variable (y) is whether the rice species is Cammeo or Osmancik.</br>
The second dataset is a Spambase dataset, a multivariate binary classification dataset, obtained at the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/94/spambase), which classifies emails as spam or non-spam. The dataset has integer and real data types. The dataset has 4601 instances with 57 features in the feature set (X). The target variable (y) is whether or not the email is spam.</br>
Correlation matrix analysis, PCA dimensionality reduction analysis and null/alternate hypotheses checks are also carried out on the datasets to examine them closely
